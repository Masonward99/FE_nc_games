# NC_Games

NC Games is a board game review website that allows users to post reviews of board games, and comment on other users reviews. 
It builds on the [backend api](https://github.com/Masonward99/nc_games) that I created and also uses firebase to allow user authentication.

## Features
- Users can post reviews
- Users can search for reviews based on genre, number of comments, date posted and number of likes.
- Users can upvote comments and reviews.
- Uses firebase authentication to create user accounts.
