# NC_Games

This is my frontend project from the northcoders bootcamp. During this project I learned about React, Axios and CSS. This project is the first major project I have created using React.

The purpose of this project is to create a board games reviews websites, where uses can post reviews, upvote other peoples reviews and leave comments on these reviews. 

This builds on my [backend](https://github.com/Masonward99/nc_games) project that I created.

**Minimimum node version v18.14**
